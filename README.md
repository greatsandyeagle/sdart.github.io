Welcome to my art shop. I'm a line artist transforming your photo into a digital line portrait (hand-drawn, high-resolution PNGs or other file formats).

How to purchase:  
*Step 1*. Send me a photo you'd like me to work on.  
*Step 2*. Chill and wait for a few days, usually <= 2 days. I will send you part of the line art(say, 50%) that I complete.  
*Step 3*. If you are satisfied with the work, start to pay. Otherwise, just let me know how you want me to improve it.  
*Step 4*. After the payment is received, I will send you the full image.

You are free to specify line color, background color, file formats, etc. The default setting is: black line + white background. If you have any questions or requests, don't hesitate to contact me.

Last but not the least...Once you receive the image, feel free to print it, frame it, decorate your home or make a gift!
