Welcome to my art shop. I'm a line artist transforming your photo into a digital line portrait (high-resolution PNGs or other file formats).

How to purchase:  
*Step 1*. Send me a photo you'd like me to work on. You can specify line color, background color, file formats, etc. The default setting is: black line + white background.  
*Step 2*. Chill and wait for a few days, usually <= 2 days. I will send you part of the line art(say, 50%) that I complete.  
*Step 3*. If you are satisfied with the work, start to pay. Otherwise, just let me know how you want me to improve it.  
*Step 4*. After the payment is received, I will send you the full image.

Last but not the least...Once you receive the image, feel free to print it, frame it, decorate your home or make a gift!
