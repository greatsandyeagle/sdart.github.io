Message me with a nice photo and I'll turn it into an **HD hand-drawn line portrait in a digital format (say, PNG)**. You can then print it, frame it, light up your home!

# How to Order

**FYI: <span style="color:red">You don't have to pay until you are satisfied with the line portrait!</span>**

## Place an Order in Two Steps!
**Step 1** - Email me the photo(s) you'd like me to work on. My email is: greatsandyeagle@gmail.com   
**Step 2** - Chill and wait for my reply! A confirmation will be sent within 24 hours. I'll finish the work within 2 days.    


## Preview the artwork and Purchase if you are satisfied
- Within 2 days after the photo is received, I will send you part of the line art(say, 50%) that I complete.    
- If you are satisfied with it, start to pay. Otherwise, just let me know how you want me to improve it.    
- **Payment: PayPal**
- After the payment is received, I will send you the full image in the format you choose (default: PNG).

The default setting is: black line + white background. You are free to choose line color, background color, file formats, etc. Just let me know!
